# Createrington Currency

https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/create-rington-currency

**Createrington Currency** is a custom Minecraft mod designed to bring an economy system into your game.

## Description
This mod is currently in development and is designed to interface with an external backend server. Unlike typical Minecraft mods that store data locally or in server files, this mod relies entirely on a remote server to store and manage all of its data.

All player currency data — such as balances, deposits, withdrawals, and transactions — is handled through API calls to a custom backend service. This approach allows for persistent, centralized, and scalable data management across different servers or worlds.

Important: To use this mod, you must have a custom backend server set up to handle all data storage and logic. The mod will not function without it. 

> ⚠️ This mod is currently **under active development** and not ready for production use.

## Features (Planned / In Progress)
- Withdraw and deposit virtual currency via chat commands.
- Bill denominations (e.g., $1, $5, $10, ..., $1000).
- Player balances and leaderboards (`/money`, `/baltop`).
- Backend integration for secure transactions.

## Status

This repository is a **work-in-progress**. Expect frequent changes, breaking updates, and incomplete features.  
You're welcome to watch or contribute — but please understand things may be unstable.

## Development

This mod is being built using **Minecraft NeoForge** and integrates with a **Backend API**.
